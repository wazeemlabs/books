Sleeping LLM
A language model that forms persistent memories from conversation and consolidates them through sleep.
During
wake
, facts are injected directly into model weights via
MEMIT
— no retrieval, no database, no context stuffing. During
sleep
, a maintenance cycle audits and refreshes degraded memories, then
LoRA consolidation
progressively transfers knowledge from MEMIT (fast, brittle, capacity-limited weight edits) into fused LoRA (slow, stable, high-capacity fine-tuning). As LoRA absorbs each fact, MEMIT edits dissolve — clearing the buffer for new memories.
Inspired by
Complementary Learning Systems
theory from neuroscience: fast encoding during wake, protective consolidation during sleep. MEMIT is short-term memory; LoRA is long-term memory. Sleep is the transfer between them.

LoRA consolidation
: 100% fact advancement rate at 5/10/15/20 facts. Chat recall reaches 1.00 by cycle 2–3 as LoRA absorbs all knowledge. MEMIT edits dissolve on schedule (scale 1.0 → 0.5 → 0.1 → 0.0), making effective lifetime capacity unbounded.
Sleep convergence
: 30 facts at 40% initial recall recover to 100% within 4 sleep cycles. The 70B model converges 2x faster.
Wake capacity threshold
: The 8B model sustains 0.92 recall up to 13 unconstrained edits, then crashes to 0.57 at 14 — a sharp phase transition from cascading edit interference, not gradual decay.
Alignment tax
: RLHF actively suppresses LoRA-injected knowledge at scale. 3B: 47% recall. 8B: 37%. 70B: 0%. This inverse scaling led us to abandon direct LoRA training during wake — but LoRA works for consolidation during sleep, where per-fact gating and cumulative fusing avoid the alignment conflict.

MEMIT = short-term memory.                  "drowsiness signal" (degraded fact count
LoRA consolidation = long-term.             exceeds threshold)
How MEMIT Works Here
Each fact (subject, relation, object) produces a weight update across target MLP layers:
W' = W + R K^T (K K^T + λ C)^{-1}
Where
K
are key vectors,
R
is the distributed residual, and
C
is the empirical covariance regularized via the Woodbury identity (keeping inversion in N×N space, not d×d).
Wake
injects without constraints — fast but interference accumulates.
Sleep
refreshes degraded edits
with
null-space constraints derived from all healthy edits — guaranteeing orthogonality to working memories. This asymmetry creates a natural rhythm: wake degrades, sleep restores.
How Consolidation Works
After MEMIT maintenance, sleep trains a LoRA adapter on all active facts (chat Q&A format), then fuses it into the base weights. Each fact has an independent consolidation stage (0–3), tracked by per-fact gating:

0.0 (MEMIT dissolved)
After each sleep cycle, facts that pass chat recall advance one stage; facts that fail retreat. An edit's effective scale is
min(fact_stages)
— conservative, only scaling down when
all
facts in the edit have advanced. Once all facts reach stage 3, the MEMIT delta is fully dissolved and the LoRA-fused weights carry the knowledge alone. This clears MEMIT capacity for new memories, making effective lifetime capacity unbounded.

Known Limitations
Synthetic facts only
— all experiments use person-city triples. Real conversational knowledge (opinions, temporal events, multi-hop) may behave differently.
Raw completion pathway
— MEMIT edits are accessible via raw text completion, not chat templates. LoRA consolidation bridges this gap by training on chat Q&A format, transferring knowledge to the chat pathway.
Single-run experiments
— no error bars or confidence intervals (tipping point at 13/14 is reproducible across configs).
No RAG comparison
— RAG solves a different problem (unlimited capacity, no weight modification) but a head-to-head comparison would strengthen the claims.
VRAM ceiling
— null-space constraint matrices grow O(N*K) with edit count. 70B/16-layer config OOMs at ~30 facts/session on 2xH100.
